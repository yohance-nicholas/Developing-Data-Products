# Developing Data Products
Maintained by Yohance Nicholas

## Overview
This repository was prepared in partial fulfilment of the Developing Data Products Course which comprises one of the five courses necessary for the Data Science: Statistics and Machine Learning Specialization offered by Johns Hopikins University through Coursera.

A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This repository covers coursework exercises required to better understand the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. 

In addition to several quizes, the course requires the completion of three Peer-Graded Assignments:

1. [**R Markdown and Leaflet**](https://yohance-nicholas.github.io/Developing-Data-Products/1_R_Markdown_and_Leaflet.html)
2. [**R Markdown Presentation & Plotly**](https://yohance-nicholas.github.io/Developing-Data-Products/2_R_Markdown_Presentation.html)
3. **[Shiny Application](https://yohance-nicholas.shinyapps.io/covid19_regression_map/) and [Reproducible Pitch](https://rpubs.com/yohance-nicholas/covid19_regression_map)**

These assignments challenge candidates to practice how to communicate using statistics and statistical products. The emphasis of the assignments is placed on how to effectively communicate uncertainty in statistical results with the assistance of simple Shiny web applications and R packages for their data products.
