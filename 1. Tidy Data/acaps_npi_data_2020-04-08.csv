(Government Package of Policy Measures to Deal with Economic Impact of COVID-19).  $5 million government has already earmarked for healthcare response, and allocating up to an additional $11 million to cover detection, isolation, treatment and other COVID-19 mitigation activities. Government is allocating $10 million to provide for a temporary unemployment benefit, administered through the National Insurance Board, for self-employed persons working in the tourism industry. Government is making a special accommodation for those self-employed individuals in the tourism industry, given the unprecedented COVID-19 impact and will offer a sponsored unemployment assistance of $200 per week, for up to eight weeks.

The National Insurance Board has agreed to relax the requirement to visit the employment exchange at Warrens. The National Insurance Board will give those on short weeks 60 per cent of their earnings for those days.  For example, if a person is put on a three-day week, then the Board will pay 60 per cent of the wages the person would have earned for the other two days.
