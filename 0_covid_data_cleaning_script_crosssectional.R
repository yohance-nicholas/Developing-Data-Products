# CARICOM COVID-19 Cases Data Cleaning Script
# Cross-Sectional Dataset of Most Recent Data
# Prepared by Yohance Nicholas
# April 8th 2020

### Rationale

# The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by
# severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was
# first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei
# province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019â€“20
# coronavirus pandemic. For this coursework project, I have opted to use Leaflet
# to map the incidence of the Novel Coronavirus among [CARICOM Member
# States](https://caricom.org/member-states-and-associate-members/). All CARICOM
# countries are classified as developing countries. They are all relatively
# small in terms of population and size, and diverse in terms of geography and
# population, culture and levels of economic and social development.  While the
# pandemic was slow to reach the CARICOM region, the begining of March saw the
# onset of the pandemic among CARICOM member states.

# Import Relevant Socio-Economic Data from the World Development Indicators Database

### Merging the COVID-19 cases with the World Bank Data

# Now that both dataframes have been generated, I proceed to merge the two and
# select CARICOM member states for mapping. In order to facilitate the analysis
# of the severity of the pandemic country by country, three new variables will
# be generated:

# * Confirmed Cases per 100,000
# * Deaths per 100,000
# * Mortality Rate 

# Merge COVID-19 Confirmed Cases, World Bank Data and Filter CARICOM Countries
